One of the most outstanding aspects of this project has been the preservation of the characteristic working style of GitHub CLI in the development of the `gh owner` command. Although initially this was not the main objective of the project, this situation has represented an excellent opportunity to acquire new knowledge, improve skills, and develop competencies in a different environment.

Regarding the current functionality of the command, there are several ideas that could be implemented to enhance its capability and make it even more comprehensive. It would be beneficial to continue expanding this functionality and gaining further insights within this project. Additionally, proposing a pull request to the repository to assess its potential acceptance would be advantageous.
